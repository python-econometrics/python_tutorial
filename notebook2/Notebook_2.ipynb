It is used to perform manipulations or actions on the objects, and can modify their state or return their information. (Note that methods are not just a feature of Python syntax; they are one of the fundamental concepts in so-called <i>object-oriented programming</i>.)<br><br>\n",

For example, suppose you have pairs of user id (not necessarily consecutive numbers) and user information data. If you will retrieve user information by user id, it is more efficient to manage data in a dictionary rather than in a list. In the following example, suppose you want to retrieve user information (user's name) and you know the user id. If you use a dictionary, you can directly access the data by specifying the id.
