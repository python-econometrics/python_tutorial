Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type. Each element in a list has index starting with 0 (Not 1!). You can access to each element by specifying the index. Suppose you have a list named \"a\". If you want to access the third element of it, for example, you need to type \"a[2]\". In the example below, lists c and d contain elements of mixed types. The difference between c and d is that in c, the third element is the string \"a\" which is just the letter a, while in d the third element is the variable a, which itself is the list defined in the first line of code.

    "#### Loops (while)\n",
    "Loop statements allow you to execute the same piece of code multiple times. Using <b>while</b> loop, you can repeat the code as long as a condition is true. The following example code runs print(a) and a = a + 1 while a < 10 is true. Note that the line a = a + 1 is critically important. Without it the loop will run forever. The lesson is that while-loops need to be written in a way so that the condition for the loop to continue is eventually false. "
